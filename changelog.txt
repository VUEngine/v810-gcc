2018-11-28 Support compilation on Linux.
           This version either fixes or hides all of the myriad extraneous
           compilation warnings that were making it impossible to see real
           problems.
           newlib now uses libgloss (as it is supposed to), rather than
           putting the board-support files into libc.

2021-09-20 Fix building V810-GCC project with the current GCC v10 compiler.
           This involved fixing or hiding the latest compilation warnings
           that GCC10 complains about. There are no functional changes.
