This project is a GCC-based C99 toolchain for the NEC V810 cpu.


THE BACKSTORY
=============

The history traces back to the work done by Japanese homebrew developers in
late 2000 to create a GCC toolchain for PC-FXGA development to replace
Hudson's old MS-DOS C compiler.

The PC-FXGA is an expansion board that plugs into a NEC PC98 or IBM PC that
allows programmers to create games for the NEC PC-FX game console (plus extra
3D capabilities that were never released for the PC-FX itself during its short
lifetime).

That toolchain was based on GCC 2.95.2 and binutils 2.10, which were the
current versions at the time.

The patches are basically modified versions of the continued GCC/binutils
support for the Renesas V850 cpu that is still manufactured and used as an
embedded microcontroller today. The Renesas V850 is a direct descendant of
the NEC V810 and shares the same basic architecture (but enhanced over the
last 25+ years).

Although a lot of those Japanese websites have disappeared over time, you can
still find the original patches and info here ...

In 2007, the homebrew community for the Nintendo VirtualBoy took the old
PC-FXGA GCC 2.95 patches and used them to make a GCC toolchain for their
console, since both consoles use the same NEC V810 cpu. Those developers
added Newlib 1.10.0 support to the toolchain to give them standard C
library functions.

In the years since then, it has become harder and harder to actually compile
GCC 2.95 any more with modern GNU toolchains which now either complain about
or totally fail to understand the old GCC source code.


THE SOLUTION
============

This project has updated/rewritten those patches to work on a more-modern
GCC toolchain that supports newer C language standards (C99 and almost-all
of C11), and that can still be built by the latest GCC compilers.

GCC 4.7.4 was chosen because it is the last version of GCC that can be
compiled with C instead of C++.

While developing these patches, a number of fixes and changes have been
made to the V810 support to better allow for modern homebrew development,
including the support for C++.

Limiting any C++ usage to the Embedded C++ language restrictions (see
http://www.caravan.net/ec2plus/rationale.html) is highly recommended
on these old V810 cpus, and C++ exceptions are definitely not supported
at all in this toolchain.
